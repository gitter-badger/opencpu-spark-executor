#R OpenCPU Spark Executor (ROSE) Library

ROSE is a Scala library offering the full scientific computing power of
the R programming language to 
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) batch and streaming
applications on the JVM. This library is built on top of the
[opencpu-r-executor](https://github.com/onetapbeyond/opencpu-r-executor)
library, a lightweight solution for integrating R analytics executed on
the [OpenCPU server](https://www.opencpu.org/) into any application
running on the JVM.

### ROSE Motivation

The popular [Apache SparkR](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/R)
package provides a lightweight front-end for data scientists to use
Apache Spark from R. This approach is ideally suited to
investigative analytics, such as ad-hoc and exploratory analysis at scale.

The ROSE library provides the same R analytics capabilities available to
Apache SparkR applications within traditional Spark applications on the JVM.
It does this by exposing new `analyze` operations that execute R analytics on
compatible RDDs. This new facility is designed specifically for
operational analytics and can be used alongside Spark core, SQL, Streaming,
MLib and GraphX. 

If you need to query R machine-learning models, score R prediction models or
leverage any other aspect of the R library in real-time environments at scale,
then the ROSE library may be for you.

### ROSE SBT Dependency

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.onetapbeyond" % "opencpu-spark-executor_2.10" % "1.0"
)
```

### ROSE Basic Usage

This library exposes new `analyze` transformations on Spark RDDs of type
`RDD[OCPUTask]`. The following sections demonstrate how to use these new
RDD operations to execute R analytics directly within Spark batch and
streaming applications on the JVM.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/onetapbeyond/opencpu-r-executor)
on the underlying `opencpu-r-executor` library for details on building
`OCPUTask` and handling `OCPUResult`.

### ROSE Spark Batch Usage

For this example we assume an input `dataRDD`, then transform it to generate
an RDD of type `RDD[OCPUTask]`. In this example each `OCPUTask` represents a
fraud score prediction to be generated by the R function `fraud::score` when
the RDD is eventually evaluated.

```
import io.onetapbeyond.opencpu.spark.executor.R._
import io.onetapbeyond.opencpu.r.executor._

val rTaskRDD = dataRDD.map(data => {
	OCPU.R()
		.pkg("fraud")
		.function("score")
		.input(data.asInput())
		.library()
	})
```

The set of `OCPUTask` within `rTaskRDD` can be scheduled for
processing by calling the new `analyze` operation provided by ROSE
on the RDD:

```
val rResultRDD = rTaskRDD.analyze
```

When `rTaskRDD.analyze` is evaluated by Spark the resultant `rResultRDD`
is of type `RDD[OCPUResult]`. The fraud prediction score for the original
`OCPUTask` are available within these `OCPUResult`. These values can be
optionally cached, further processed or persisted per the needs of your
Spark application.

Note, the use here of the R function `fraud::score` is simply representative
of any R function or script available within the full set of R packages
available on [CRAN R](https://www.r-project.org),
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) or on [github](https://github.com/).

### ROSE Spark Streaming Usage

For this example we assume an input stream `dataStream`, then transform
it to generate a new stream with underlying RDDs of type `RDD[OCPUTask]`.
In this example each `OCPUTask` represents a fraud score prediction to
be generated by the R function `fraud::score` when the stream is
eventually evaluated.

```
import io.onetapbeyond.opencpu.spark.executor.R._
import io.onetapbeyond.opencpu.r.executor._

val rTaskStream = dataStream.transform(rdd => {
	rdd.map(data => {
		OCPU.R()
			.pkg("fraud")
			.function("score")
			.input(data.asInput())
			.library()
		})	
	})
```

The set of `OCPUTask` within `rTaskStream` can be scheduled for processing
by calling the new `analyze` operation provided by ROSE on each RDD within
the stream: 

```
val rResultStream = rTaskStream.transform(rdd => rdd.analyze)
```

When `rTaskStream.transform` is evaluated by Spark the resultant
`rResultStream` has underlying RDDs of type `RDD[OCPUResult]`. The fraud
prediction score for the original `OCPUTask` are available within these
`OCPUResult`. These values can be optionally cached, further processed
or persisted per the needs of your Spark application.

Note, the use here of the R function `fraud::score` is simply
representative of any R function or script available within the full
set of R packages available on [CRAN R](https://www.r-project.org),
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) or on [github](https://github.com/).

### Traditional v ROSE Spark Application Deployment

To understand how ROSE delivers the full scientific computing power of
the R programming language to Spark applications on the JVM the following
sections compare and constrast the deployment of traditional Scala, Java,
Python and SparkR applications with Spark applications powered by the
ROSE library.

The principal deployment requirement when working with ROSE is that your
Spark cluster have access to one or more
[OpenCPU servers](https://www.opencpu.org/download.html). Deployment
options for those servers in the context of Spark are discussed in
`Application Deployment` sections 3. and 4. that follow below.

####1. Traditional Scala | Java | Python Spark Application Deployment

![Traditional Deployment: Spark](https://onetapbeyond.github.io/resource/img/rose/trad-spark-deploy.jpg)

Without ROSE library support, neither data scientists nor application
developers have access to R's analytic capabilities within these types
of application deployments.

####2. Traditional SparkR Application Deployment

![Traditional Deployment: SparkR](https://onetapbeyond.github.io/resource/img/rose/trad-sparkr-deploy.jpg)

While data scientists can leverage the computing power of Spark within R
applications in these types of application deployments, these same R
capabilities are not available to Scala, Java or Python developers.


####3. Scala | Java + R (ROSE) Spark Application Deployment

![New Deployment: opencpu-spark-executor](https://onetapbeyond.github.io/resource/img/rose/new-rose-deploy.jpg)

Both data scientists and application developers working in either Scala or
Java can leverage the full power of R using the ROSE library within these
types of application deployments.

Using this deployment configuration, each worker node on the Spark cluster
has its own dedicated `OpenCPU server` installed locally on the node. This
configuration delivers optimal runtime throughput on the cluster. Note, this
deployment configuration mirrors the configuration required by Apache
SparkR, where the R runtime environment must be installed locally on each
worker node on the cluster.

####4. Scala | Java + R (ROSE) Spark Application Deployment (Alternative)

![Alt Deployment: opencpu-spark-executor](https://onetapbeyond.github.io/resource/img/rose/alt-rose-deploy.jpg)

Both data scientists and application developers working in either Scala or
Java can leverage the full power of R using the ROSE library within these
types of application deployments.

Using this deployment configuration, a cluster of one or more
`OpenCPU servers` is maintained external to the Spark cluster. While
maintaining these servers external to the Spark cluster potentially introduces
runtime costs associated with networking latencies this approach does allow
fast prototyping for ROSE-enabled Spark applications as no configuration
changes need to be made to an existing Spark cluster to get up and running.

To take advantage of an external `OpenCPU server` cluster when working with
ROSE simply pass an `Array[String]` of one or more server endpoints to the
`analyze` transformation. For example, identify an external cluster of 3
`OpenCPU servers` for use by your Spark application:

```
val ocpuCluster = sc.broadcast(Array("http://1.1.x.x/ocpu",
									 "http://1.1.y.y/ocpu",
									 "http://1.1.z.z/ocpu"))
val rResultRDD = rTaskRDD.analyze(ocpuCluster.value)
```

As shown, the array of server endpoints should be maintained as a
broadcast variable within your Spark application. Each `OCPUTask` within
your ROSE application will automatically be distributed for execution at random
across the `OpenCPU server` cluster.
